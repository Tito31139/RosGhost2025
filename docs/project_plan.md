# Project Plan - rosGhost2025  
**Future Engineers - WRO 2025**

## 🎯 Project Objective
The goal of our robot is to complete three laps autonomously and stop in the same starting position. The robot must navigate while detecting obstacles and maintaining its course, using sensors and programming logic.

## 📜 Challenge Compliance
The robot is designed to meet all requirements from the Future Engineers category of WRO 2025.  
- It uses the **maximum allowed number of motors**.  
- It incorporates **different types of sensors** to solve the challenge.  
- It is fully constructed using **LEGO Mindstorms parts**.

## 🧱 Components and Construction
We use:
- 1 Large motor for forward movement.
- 1 Medium motor for steering.
- 3 Ultrasonic sensors (front and sides).
- LEGO Mindstorms Hub.
- LEGO wheels and custom LEGO elements for the body.

The chassis and structure were fully built using official LEGO parts.

## 💻 Programming Approach
The robot is programmed using the LEGO Mindstorms **Inventor app**, combining:
- **Block-based programming** for structural logic and movement.
- **Python** code for sensor control and distance calculations.

The robot measures the initial distance and compares it with the final one, stopping once it returns to its starting zone or reaches a shorter distance. It detects both front and side obstacles to adjust its path.

## 🧪 Testing and Results
- Successfully detects front and side barriers.
- Completed the 3-lap sequence in tests.
- Stops accurately near its initial point.
- Needs better optimization for performance in the **second round**.

## 🔧 Planned Improvements
- Optimize the navigation logic for lap 2.
- Improve sensor calibration and response time.
- Refine turning angles and path correction.

## 👥 Team Members and Roles
- **Tito Quintero**: Programming, logic, and testing.
- **Fiorella Campos**: Assembly, building, documentation, GitHub uploads.
- **José Filos**: Assembly, building, project coordination, GitHub support.
