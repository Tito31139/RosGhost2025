# rosGhost2025 - Future Engineers WRO 2025

## ðŸ‘¥ Team Introduction
We are the **rosGhost2025** team participating in the Future Engineers category of the WRO 2025 robotics competition.

## ðŸ¤– Project Description
Our robot is built using LEGO Mindstorms Inventor. It is designed to navigate autonomously by detecting obstacles using ultrasonic sensors and maneuvering using motorized steering.

## ðŸ”§ Components List

| Component                          | Quantity | Description                                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Large Motor (LEGO Mindstorms)     | 1        | Responsible for forward rotation, providing the main driving force to move the robot ahead.|
| Medium Motor (LEGO Mindstorms)    | 1        | Controls steering by directing the front wheels for turning.                               |
| Ultrasonic Sensors                | 3        | Measure distances at different locations around the robot to detect obstacles.             |
| LEGO Mindstorms Hub               | 1        | The brain of the robot, controlling motors and sensors, running the program.               |
| Wheels                            | 4        | Provide traction and mobility for the robotâ€™s movement.                                    |

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Program
1. Connect the LEGO Mindstorms Hub to your computer or tablet.
2. Open the LEGO Mindstorms app and load the program from the `scr/programacion lego` folder.
3. Place the robot on the field and start the program.
4. The robot will begin navigating and avoiding obstacles using the ultrasonic sensors.
