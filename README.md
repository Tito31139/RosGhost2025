# rosGhost2025 - Future Engineers WRO 2025

## Team Introduction
We are the **rosGhost2025** team participating in the Future Engineers category of the WRO 2025 robotics competition.

## Project Description
Our robot is built using LEGO Mindstorms Inventor. It is designed to navigate autonomously by detecting obstacles using ultrasonic sensors and maneuvering with precise motor control.

## Components List
- Large Motor (LEGO Mindstorms) - 1 unit: Drives the robot forward.
- Medium Motor (LEGO Mindstorms) - 1 unit: Controls steering of front wheels.
- Ultrasonic Sensors - 3 units: Measure distance to obstacles on front and sides.
- LEGO Mindstorms Hub - 1 unit: The main controller.
- Wheels - 4 units: Provide mobility and traction.

## How to Run the Program
1. Connect the LEGO Mindstorms Hub to your computer or tablet.
2. Upload the program from the [src](src/) folder using the LEGO Mindstorms app.
3. Place the robot on the competition field and start the program.
4. The robot will navigate avoiding obstacles using the ultrasonic sensors.

## Schematics and Design
See the diagrams and files in the [schemes](schemes/) folder for sensor placement and motor connections.  
See photos and documentation in the [model](model/) folder to learn about the robotâ€™s physical design.

## Video Demonstrations
Watch videos of the robot in action in the [video](video/) folder.
